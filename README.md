# Panaly - Project Analyzer

This project aims to deliver an extendable tool to analyze a project's source code for various metrics. Whether you have
a code coverage report, baselines for static analyzers, or file system metrics, Panaly can aggregate them based on your
custom configuration and provide comprehensive reporting.

The plugin system ensures customization at every step, from configuration to metric collection, storage, and reporting.
Future updates will enable active event listening, allowing plugins to further customize the analysis process.

## Features

- Extensible plugin system
- Customizable metric collection
- Comprehensive reporting

## Setup

> :warning: **Work in Progress Project**

Install the package using Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev panaly/panaly
```

Create a `panaly.dist.yaml` file and configure it based on the plugins you need. Without any plugins, no actions will be
performed. Refer to the example configuration in this repository for guidance.

## Usage

By default, the CLI command searches for a `panaly.dist.yaml` configuration file. You can specify a different
configuration file using the `-c` option:

```bash
vendor/bin/panaly -c my-own-config.yaml
```

## Example Configuration

  ```yaml
# panaly.dist.yaml
plugins: # Registered plugins that deliver single metrics that could be utilized for metric groups
    Namespace/Of/The/Project/FilesystemPlugin: ~ # registers a "filesystem_directory_count" and a "filesystem_file_count" metric
    Namespace/Of/Another/Project/PHPStanBaselinePlugin: ~ # registers a simple "phpstan_baseline_total_count" metric
    I/Have/A/Storage/Engine/LocalJsonStoragePlugin: ~ # registers a "local_json" storage and also a "metric_history_timeframe" metric that shows from / to string of all-time metric reading
    My/Own/Plugin/HtmlReportPlugin: ~ # registers the "my_own_html_reporting" reporting that takes the result collection of the metrics and does something with it

## Plugins

Panaly relies on a wide plugin system and does not provide metric collection, storage, or reporting features by itself.
Each plugin can specialize in a single task or deliver a full feature set from metric collection to storage handling and
report generation.

Plugins are the most essential part of configuring a Panaly run. Each plugin has a base class that defines how it
interacts with Panaly and the features it provides.

A plugin can extend the `Panaly\Plugin\BasePlugin` class to avoid implementing all methods individually, as the methods
are called independently and do nothing if left empty.

The following methods are available:

| Method                  | Description                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `initialize`            | Mainly used to register event listeners for events triggered during a Panaly run.                                                  |
| `getAvailableMetrics`   | Returns a list of `Panaly\Plugin\Plugin\Metric` implementing classes to be used as metric collectors.                              |
| `getAvailableStorages`  | Returns a list of `Panaly\Plugin\Plugin\Storage` implementing classes that handle storage tasks for the metric collection results. |
| `getAvailableReporting` | Returns a list of `Panaly\Plugin\Plugin\Reporting` implementing classes that generate reports from the metric collection results.  |

## Events

The event system is a work in progress. Future updates will allow plugins to register event listeners, enabling them to
hook into events beyond delivering metrics, reporting, or storage.

| Event                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Panaly\Configuration\ConfigurationFile\BeforeMetricCalculate | Dispatched before a metric collection method is executed, allowing modification of metric options directly before execution.                                                                                                                                      |
| Panaly\Configuration\ConfigurationFile\ConfigurationLoaded   | Dispatched after the `ConfigurationFile` is loaded, allowing the full configuration to be overwritten by delivering a new instance.                                                                                                                               |
| Panaly\Configuration\ConfigurationFile\RuntimeLoaded         | Dispatched after the configuration is fully loaded and converted to the `RuntimeConfiguration`, providing the last opportunity to change the metric running process.                                                                                              |
| Panaly\Configuration\ConfigurationFile\MetricResultCreated   | Dispatched when the collection or execution of configured metric groups is finished, allowing modification of the result before storage and reporting. The full environment is provided, including the `ConfigurationFile`, `RuntimeConfiguration`, and `Result`. |
